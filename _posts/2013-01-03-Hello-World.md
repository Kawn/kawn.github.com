I used [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) (a blog-aware, static site generator in Ruby) for make this blog.
The current theme is based in the [Midnight theme](https://github.com/mattgraham/Midnight) by mattgraham.

And Now, some tests
-----------------------------------------------------

Code highlight:

{% highlight c++ linenos %}

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
void main()
{
  cout << "Hello World!" << endl;
}
{% endhighlight %}
